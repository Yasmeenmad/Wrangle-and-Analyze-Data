# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 1

## Wrangle and Analyze Data

#### Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, We will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

#### Project Details
our tasks in this project are as follows:

- Data wrangling, which consists of:
  - Gathering data.
  - Assessing data.
  - Cleaning data.
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data.
- Reporting on our data wrangling efforts and our data analyses and visualizations.
